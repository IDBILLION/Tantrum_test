    <h4>There is a scenario i encounter about during schools</h4>
    <p>A man got a loan from the bank with an agreement of making full payment of the loan on 31st december of the same here he got the loan. This man has the money as cash with him since 18th of december but decided to use the money to run a business deal
        with a profit before the loan deadline. Luckily, he got the money back before the deadline of the loan. Due to the busy activities of citizens wanting to travel to their hometown to celebrate the New year eve's he was unable to deposit the money
        into the account. He went to bank by 2nd January to deposit the money for the the bank rejected the loan and take over his property. He charged the bank to court but he lost the case because agreement is agreement 31st december was the day assigned
        to pay the loan not 2nd of January. <b>Moral of the story:</b> You should always be careful with agreement being signed when taking a loan from any Mortgage bank.
